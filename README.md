# NET.S.2018.Kononenko.16

1. Create generalized classes for the representation of a square, symmetric and diagonal matrix (a symmetrical matrix is ​​a square matrix that coincides with its transpose to it, a diagonal matrix is ​​a square matrix whose elements in front of the main diagonal obviously have default values ​​for the element type). Describe in the created classes an event that occurs when a matrix element with indices (i, j) changes. Expand the functionality of the existing class hierarchy, adding the ability to add two matrices of any type. Develop unit-tests.
